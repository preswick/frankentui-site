# Hello, World!

Welcome to my new blog! This is the first post on my terminal-themed personal website.

## Why Terminal Aesthetics?

I've always loved the look of terminal interfaces. There's something beautiful about:

- Monospace fonts with perfect alignment
- Unicode box-drawing characters
- Phosphor glow and CRT effects
- The simplicity of text-based interfaces

## Tech Stack

This site is built with:

```python
from fasthtml.common import *

# Simple, fast, and fun
app = FastHTML()
```

It uses:
- **FastHTML** for the backend
- **Custom CSS** for terminal effects
- **Canvas animations** for visual effects
- **Multiple theme presets**

## Try the Theme Switcher

Use the theme switcher in the header to try different color schemes:

- **Cyberpunk Aurora** - Neon blues and magentas
- **Darcula** - JetBrains-inspired dark theme
- **Nordic Frost** - Cool, muted tones
- **Lumen Light** - A clean light option

Thanks for reading! More posts coming soon.
